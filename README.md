# UI Design
I started the project by going over the brief, and making some basic wireframe sketches. 

Then I used the shad-cn figma component library to fully design the UI. 

A link to the figma file can be found here:

During development, I decided against using shad-ui. This is because I felt that the project was not large enough to warrant spending the time to go through the documentation of shad-ui, especially since I have no real understanding of how solid-js worked yet. Instead, I built everything from scratch using tailwind. 
# Research
Before this project, I had absolutely zero experience with solidJS or solidstart other than hearing the name. A large chunk of the time dedicated to this project was spent researching solidJS, how it compares to React, and what is the best way to use it. 

The same goes for supabase, I had zero experience with supabase (or firebase). The only experience I had with "backend as a service" products, was in my gym app (www.dylanmurphy.dev/gym-site) where I used PocketBase. 

Having only a week to complete this project, a lot of research was done during development, constantly going back and forth between research and development for both the frontend and the backend. 

# Reflection
I really enjoyed working with SolidJS and supabase, I fully intend to incorporate both into my projects in the future, There are so many more features I would have liked to implement, but I simply did not have the time, some of these features include:
- Proper authentication/RLS support
- Adding/Updating/Deletion of Families
- Loading visualisers.
